## Differentiation of Vector-Valued Functions

In multivariate calculus, vector-valued functions map points from one vector space to another. Differentiating vector-valued functions involves computing derivatives with respect to a variable and can be extended to multiple variables. This process is crucial in fields such as physics and engineering, where vector functions often represent trajectories, forces, or fields.

### Definition

1. **Vector-Valued Function**:
   - **Definition**: A vector-valued function $\mathbf{r}(t)$ assigns a vector to each point in its domain. For example, in three-dimensional space, a vector-valued function can be represented as:
   
     $$
     \mathbf{r}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
     x(t) \\
     y(t) \\
     z(t)
     \end{bmatrix}
     $$
     
     where $x(t)$, $y(t)$, and $z(t)$ are scalar functions of the variable $t$.

2. **Derivative of a Vector-Valued Function**:
   - **Definition**: The derivative of a vector-valued function is obtained by differentiating each component function with respect to the variable. If $\mathbf{r}(t)$ is given by:
   
     $$
     \mathbf{r}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
     x(t) \\
     y(t) \\
     z(t)
     \end{bmatrix}
     $$
     
     then its derivative with respect to $t$ is:
     
     $$
     \mathbf{r}'(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
     \frac{dx(t)}{dt} \\
     \frac{dy(t)}{dt} \\
     \frac{dz(t)}{dt}
     \end{bmatrix}
     $$

### Examples

1. **Example 1: Straight Line**

   Consider the vector-valued function representing a straight line in 3D space:
   
   $$
   \mathbf{r}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
   t \\
   2t \\
   3t
   \end{bmatrix}
   $$
   
   - **Find the Derivative**:
     
     Compute the derivative with respect to $t$:
     
     $$
     \mathbf{r}'(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
     \frac{d}{dt}(t) \\
     \frac{d}{dt}(2t) \\
     \frac{d}{dt}(3t)
     \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
     1 \\
     2 \\
     3
     \end{bmatrix}
     $$
     
     The result is a constant vector, indicating that the direction of the line is constant.

2. **Example 2: Curve in 2D**

   Consider the vector-valued function representing a curve in 2D space:
   
   $$
   \mathbf{r}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos(t) \\
   \sin(t)
   \end{bmatrix}
   $$
   
   - **Find the Derivative**:
     
     Compute the derivative with respect to $t$:
     
     $$
     \mathbf{r}'(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
     \frac{d}{dt}(\cos(t)) \\
     \frac{d}{dt}(\sin(t))
     \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
     -\sin(t) \\
     \cos(t)
     \end{bmatrix}
     $$
     
     This derivative vector represents the tangent to the curve at each point $t$.

### Applications

1. **Trajectory Analysis**: In physics and engineering, vector-valued functions describe the position of objects over time. Differentiation yields velocity and acceleration vectors.
2. **Optimization**: In optimization problems involving vector fields, gradients and directional derivatives are computed to find optimal solutions.
3. **Differential Geometry**: In differential geometry, vector-valued functions describe curves and surfaces, and their derivatives provide information about curvature and surface properties.

### Techniques

1. **Partial Derivatives**: For functions of several variables, the partial derivative of each component function with respect to each variable is computed. If $\mathbf{r}(x, y)$ is given by:
   
   $$
   \mathbf{r}(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix}
   x^2 y \\
   e^x \cos(y)
   \end{bmatrix}
   $$
   
   then the partial derivatives are:
   
   $$
   \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial x} = \begin{bmatrix}
   2xy \\
   e^x \cos(y)
   \end{bmatrix}, \quad \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial y} = \begin{bmatrix}
   x^2 \\
   -e^x \sin(y)
   \end{bmatrix}
   $$
   
2. **Gradient and Divergence**: For scalar fields and vector fields, the gradient and divergence are computed, respectively, to analyze the behavior of the functions over space.

In summary, differentiating vector-valued functions involves taking the derivative of each component function with respect to a variable. This process is essential for analyzing vector fields, trajectories, and optimization problems in multivariate calculus.

# Orthogonality of Vectors in Linear Algebra

In linear algebra, two vectors are said to be **orthogonal** if they are perpendicular to each other. This concept is crucial in various applications, including vector spaces, geometric interpretations, and orthogonal projections.

## Definition of Orthogonality

Two vectors $u$ and $v$ in an inner product space are considered **orthogonal** if their inner product (or dot product) is zero. Specifically, if $\langle u, v \rangle$ denotes the inner product of $u$ and $v$, then $u$ and $v$ are orthogonal if:
$$
\langle u, v \rangle = 0
$$

In the context of Euclidean space, where the inner product is the dot product, this condition translates to:
$$
u \cdot v = 0
$$

Here, $u \cdot v$ represents the dot product of vectors $u$ and $v$.

## Properties of Orthogonal Vectors

1. **Geometric Interpretation**:
   - Orthogonal vectors are perpendicular to each other in the geometric sense. If you visualize the vectors in a Cartesian coordinate system, they form a right angle where they intersect.

2. **Zero Vector**:
   - The zero vector is orthogonal to every vector in the space, including itself. For any vector $v$ and the zero vector $0$, we have:
     $$
     0 \cdot v = 0
     $$

3. **Orthogonal Projections**:
   - The orthogonal projection of a vector onto another vector (or subspace) simplifies when the vectors are orthogonal. In orthogonal projections, the projection of a vector onto an orthogonal basis can be computed easily.

## Examples of Orthogonal Vectors

### Example 1: Orthogonal Vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$

Consider the vectors:
$$
u = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad v = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

1. **Dot Product**:
   $$
   u \cdot v = (1 \cdot 0) + (0 \cdot 1) = 0
   $$

Since the dot product is zero, the vectors $u$ and $v$ are orthogonal.

2. **Geometric Interpretation**:
   - The vectors $u$ and $v$ are the standard unit vectors along the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. They are perpendicular to each other, forming a right angle.

### Example 2: Orthogonal Vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$

Consider the vectors:
$$
u = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad v = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
$$

1. **Dot Product**:
   $$
   u \cdot v = (1 \cdot 4) + (2 \cdot (-1)) + (3 \cdot 2)
   $$
   $$
   u \cdot v = 4 - 2 + 6 = 8
   $$

Since the dot product is not zero, the vectors $u$ and $v$ are not orthogonal.

### Example 3: Orthogonal Vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$

Consider the vectors:
$$
u = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad v = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad w = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

1. **Dot Products**:
   - For $u$ and $v$:
     $$
     u \cdot v = (1 \cdot 1) + (1 \cdot (-1)) + (1 \cdot 0) = 1 - 1 + 0 = 0
     $$

   - For $u$ and $w$:
     $$
     u \cdot w = (1 \cdot 1) + (1 \cdot 0) + (1 \cdot (-1)) = 1 + 0 - 1 = 0
     $$

   - For $v$ and $w$:
     $$
     v \cdot w = (1 \cdot 1) + (-1 \cdot 0) + (0 \cdot (-1)) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1
     $$

   The vectors $u$ and $v$ are orthogonal, as well as $u$ and $w$. However, $v$ and $w$ are not orthogonal.

## Conclusion

Orthogonality is a fundamental concept in linear algebra that signifies the perpendicular relationship between vectors. Understanding orthogonality helps in various aspects of vector analysis, matrix operations, and geometric interpretations.

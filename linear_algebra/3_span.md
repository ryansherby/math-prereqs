# Span in Linear Algebra

In linear algebra, the **span** of a set of vectors is the collection of all possible linear combinations of those vectors. The span of a set of vectors essentially represents all the vectors that can be reached by scaling and adding the original vectors together. It is a way of describing a subspace of a vector space that is generated by a specific set of vectors.

## Definition of Span

Given a set of vectors $\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \dots, \mathbf{v}_k\}$ in a vector space $V$, the **span** of these vectors, denoted as $\text{Span}\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \dots, \mathbf{v}_k\}$, is defined as the set of all possible linear combinations of the vectors:

$$
\text{Span}\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \dots, \mathbf{v}_k\} = \left\{ c_1\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2\mathbf{v}_2 + \dots + c_k\mathbf{v}_k \mid c_1, c_2, \dots, c_k \in \mathbb{R} \right\}
$$

Here, $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_k$ are scalars from the field over which the vector space is defined (commonly $\mathbb{R}$ for real vector spaces).

## Properties of the Span

1. **Subspace**: The span of a set of vectors is always a subspace of the vector space $V$. This means that the span is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication and contains the zero vector.

2. **Smallest Subspace**: The span is the smallest subspace that contains all the vectors $\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \dots, \mathbf{v}_k\}$. Any other subspace containing these vectors will also contain the span.

3. **Dependent and Independent Vectors**: If the vectors in the set are linearly independent, the span will have a dimension equal to the number of vectors. If some vectors are linearly dependent, they do not add any new directions to the span, and the dimension will be less than the number of vectors.

## Examples of Span

1. **Single Vector**: The span of a single non-zero vector $\mathbf{v}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the set of all scalar multiples of $\mathbf{v}$, which forms a line through the origin in the direction of $\mathbf{v}$.

   - **Example**: The span of the vector $\mathbf{v} = (2, 3)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is the line:
     $$
     \text{Span}\{\mathbf{v}\} = \{c(2, 3) \mid c \in \mathbb{R}\}
     $$

2. **Two Vectors**: The span of two linearly independent vectors $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is the entire plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. Any vector in the plane can be expressed as a linear combination of $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$.

   - **Example**: The span of the vectors $\mathbf{v}_1 = (1, 0)$ and $\mathbf{v}_2 = (0, 1)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is:
     $$
     \text{Span}\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2\} = \{c_1(1, 0) + c_2(0, 1) \mid c_1, c_2 \in \mathbb{R}\} = \mathbb{R}^2
     $$

3. **Three Vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$**: The span of three linearly independent vectors $\mathbf{v}_1$, $\mathbf{v}_2$, and $\mathbf{v}_3$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is the entire space $\mathbb{R}^3$. If the vectors are linearly dependent, the span will be a plane or a line within $\mathbb{R}^3$.

   - **Example**: The span of the vectors $\mathbf{v}_1 = (1, 0, 0)$, $\mathbf{v}_2 = (0, 1, 0)$, and $\mathbf{v}_3 = (0, 0, 1)$ is:
     $$
     \text{Span}\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3\} = \mathbb{R}^3
     $$

## Conclusion

The span of a set of vectors provides a powerful way to understand the subspace they generate within a vector space. It allows us to describe the "reach" of a set of vectors in terms of all the possible directions and magnitudes we can achieve by combining them. The concept of span is foundational in linear algebra and is closely related to concepts like linear independence, basis, and dimension.
